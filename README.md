# Missionaries-vs.-Cannibals
Missionaries vs. Cannibals is an interactive GUI-based solution to the classic problem using Python's tkinter. The challenge is to safely move three missionaries and three cannibals across a river with a boat that can carry at most two people, ensuring missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either bank.
